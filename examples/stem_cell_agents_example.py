"""
Example: Stem Cell AI Agents - Polymorphic Resilience

Demonstrates the revolutionary stem cell agent concept for enterprise resilience.
Just as biological stem cells can differentiate into any cell type, Stem Cell AI
Agents can transform into any agent type needed by the enterprise.

This provides:
- High availability through instant agent replacement
- Elastic scaling through dynamic differentiation
- Disaster recovery through rapid swarm reconstitution
- Cost optimization through adaptive resource allocation

Scenarios demonstrated:
1. High Availability: Replace failed agent
2. Surge Capacity: Handle Black Friday traffic spike
3. Security Response: DDoS defense with instant agent army
4. Disaster Recovery: Reconstruct failed site
5. Cost Optimization: Dynamic resource consolidation
6. A/B Testing: Canary deployments
7. Multi-site Resilience: Global enterprise deployment

This is the breakthrough for enterprise-grade AI agent deployments.

Key Insight:
Just as your body maintains stem cells that can become any cell type when needed,
ANTS maintains a pool of polymorphic agents that can become any agent type when
the swarm needs them. This provides resilience without the cost of running
redundant specialized agents 24/7.
